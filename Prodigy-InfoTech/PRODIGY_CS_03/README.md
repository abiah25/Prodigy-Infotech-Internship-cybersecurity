# **Task 3**  
**Password Complexity Checker**  

This Python program analyzes the **strength of a password** based on multiple security factors, providing users with feedback on their password's security level. It also offers tips to help users create stronger passwords and understand essential password security practices.  

### **Features**  

- **Password Strength Evaluation:** Checks password length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
- **Strength Feedback:** Categorizes the password as **very strong, strong, moderate, or weak** based on complexity.  
- **Password Masking:** Ensures privacy by masking the password input.  
- **Security Tips:** Provides best practices for creating and maintaining secure passwords.  

### **Usage**  

1. **Run the Program:** Start the Password Complexity Checker.  
2. **Read Tips:** Review suggestions for creating a secure password.  
3. **Enter Password:** Input the password to be evaluated.  
4. **View Feedback:** The program displays the masked password along with its security rating.  

This program was developed as part of my internship at **The Prodigy Infotech**, demonstrating a practical approach to **password security assessment** and user education.
