Task 1
Caesar Cipher Program

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting characters in a message. The program is designed to be intuitive, with step-by-step prompts guiding the user through the process.

Features
Encryption and Decryption: The program supports both encrypting and decrypting messages using a user-defined shift value.

User Input: Users can enter their message and specify the shift value for the cipher.

Usage
Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Caesar Cipher tool.

Select Action: Choose 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.

Enter Message: Input the text you want to process.

Specify Shift: Provide the shift value for character transformation.

View Result: The program outputs the encrypted or decrypted message.

This program was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, demonstrating basic encryption and decryption techniques using the Caesar Cipher.
